//Simple class to manage Euler angles
//Main purpose is to provides conversion methods
//to/from quaternion representation
//
//We adopt a modified "NASA Standard Aeroplane" convention
//in which the y and z axes are swapped relative to the definition in
//http://www.euclideanspace.com/maths/geometry/rotations/euler/index.htm
//(and related links).
//This should be equivalent to the VRML convention.
// 
//An object's orientation is defined in terms of:
//
//1) heading (-PI to +PI) (rotation around z) (y in NASA Aeroplane)
//2) attitude (-PI/2 to +PI/2) (rotation around y) (z in NASA Aeroplane)
//3) bank (-PI to +PI) (rotation around x)
//
//See http://www.euclideanspace.com/maths/geometry/rotations/euler/index.htm
//and related links for definitions and conversion equations.
//
//NOTE: This class is designed to provide fast conversion between Euler angles
//and quaternions. It is the callers responsibility to ensure that:
//a) heading, attitude and bank angles are within range
//b) quaternions passed to the constructor and SetQuat are of unit length
//Run-time exceptions may occur if these conditions are not met.
