rDOCK BUILD INSTRUCTIONS

BACKGROUND

rDock is written in C++ and makes heavy use of the C++ Standard Template Library (STL).
All source code is compiled into a single shared library (libRbt.so).
The executables are light-weight command-line applications linked with libRbt.so.

rDock should compile on the majority of Unix/Linux platforms with little or no
modification. However, only the following combinations have been thoroughly
tested:

SuSE 9.2 (2.6.8-24.18 kernel), g++ 3.3.4, -march=pentium3 (INTEL)
SuSE 9.2 (2.6.8-24.18 kernel), g++ 3.3.4, -march=k8 (AMD Opteron)
SuSE 9.2 (2.6.8-24.18 kernel), pathCC 2.1,-march=opteron (AMD Opteron)

PREREQUISITES

Make sure you have the following packages installed:
gcc		GNU C compiler (or your preferred C compiler)
g++		GNU C++ compiler (or your preferred C++ compiler)
popt		Command-line argument processing (run-time)
popt-devel	Command-line argument processing (compile-time)
cppunit		C++ unit testing framework (port of JUnit)

BASIC BUILD INSTRUCTIONS

Step 1) BUILD

Either:

$ make linux-g++           for 32-bit build with g++ compiler
$ make linux-g++-64        for 64-bit build with g++ compiler
or
$ make linux-pathCC-64     for 64-bit AMD Opteron build with PathScale compiler

If wish to use a different compiler/architecture combination, or if you wish to
change the compiler flags, see below.

The built libraries and executables are copied to their run-time locations
(../lib and ../bin) as part of Step 1.

Step 2) TEST

$ make test                Runs rDock unit tests

If any failed tests are reported, please email XXX, otherwise you are all set.

Step 3) INSTALL

You can either run rDock directly from the build location (only recommended for
initial testing), or install the binaries and data files to a new location
(recommended for "production" use).

a) make dist		Creates binary distribution (.tgz file)

b) Copy rdock_<CODELINE>.tgz to the desired location

c) tar xvzf rdock_<CODELINE>.tgz


OTHER MAKE TARGETS
make src_dist		Creates source distribution
make clean              Removes all intermediate build files
make distclean          Also removes installed libs and exes in ../lib and ../bin
