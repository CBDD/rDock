Value is a conservative overestimate and represents the minimal sphere radius that is guaranteed to include all allowable atom coordinates. The actual tethered volume can be quite complex (combination of translation and rotation) and calculating the boundaries analytically proved to be too complicated.

> 	Changed the zero-point desolvation score for solvent models to exclude the inter-solvent interactions in the intial PDB conformation. Reason: we don't know whether individual solvent models will be enabled or not. This way, we get a natural desolvation penalty for enabled solvent models, due to their desolvation interactions with other solvent and with the receptor. The OW ASP value becomes the critical controlling factor for the penalty strength.
