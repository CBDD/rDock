throughput protocol. The following steps should be followed:
1) exhaustive docking of a small representative part of the entire
  library.
2) Store the result of sdreport -t over that exhaustive docking run
  in a file <sdreport_file> which will be the input of this script.
3) Run rbhtfinder, specifying -i <sdreport_file> and an arbitrary
  number of filters specified using the -f option, for example
  "-f column=6,steps=5,min=0.5,max=1.0,interval=0.1". This example
  would simulate the effect of applying thresholds on column 6 after
  5 poses have been generated, for values between 0.5 and 1.0 (i.e.
  0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9, 1.0). More than one threshold can be
  specified, e.g., "-f column=4,steps=5,min=-12,max=-10,interval=1
  -f column=4,steps=15,min=-16,max=-15,interval=1" will test the
  following combinations of thresholds on column 4:
            5   -10     15      -15
            5   -11     15      -15
            5   -12     15      -15
            5   -10     15      -16
            5   -11     15      -16
            5   -12     15      -16
  The number of combinations will increase very rapidly, the more
  filters are used and the larger the range of values specified for
  each. It may be sensible to run rbhtfinder several times to explore
  the effects of various filters independently.

  The output of the program consists of the following columns.
            FILTER1 NSTEPS1 THR1    PERC1   TOP500_SCORE.INTER  ENRICH_SCORE.INTER      TIME
            SCORE.INTER     5       -13.00  6.04    72.80   12.05   0.0500
            SCORE.INTER     5       -12.00  9.96    82.80   8.31    0.0500
  The four columns are repeated for each filter specified with the -f
  option: name of the column on which the filter is applied
  (FILTER1), number of steps at which the threshold is applied
  (NSTEPS1), value of the threshold (THR1)   and the percentage of
  poses which pass this filter (PERC1). Additional filters (FILTER2,
  FILTER3 etc.) are listed in the order that they are applied (i.e.
  by NSTEPS).

  The final columns provide some overall statistics for the
  combination of thresholds specified in a row. TOP500_SCORE.INTER
  gives the percentage of the top-scoring 500 poses, measured by
  SCORE.INTER, from the whole of <sdreport_file> which are retained
  after the thresholds are applied. This can be contrasted with the
  final PERC column. The higher the ratio (the 'enrichment factor'),
  the better the combination of thresholds. If thresholds are applied
  on multiple columns, this column will be duplicated for each, e.g.
  TOP500_SCORE.INTER and TOP500_SCORE.RESTR will give the percentage
  of the top-scoring poses retained for both of these scoring
  methods. The exact number of poses used for this validation can be
  changed from the default 500 using the --validation flag.
  ENRICH_SCORE.INTER gives the enrichment factor as a quick
  rule-of-thumb to assess the best choice of thresholds. The final
  column TIME provides an estimate of the time taken to perform
  docking, as a proportion of the time taken for exhaustive docking.
  This value should be below 0.1.

  After a combination of thresholds has been selected, they need to
  be encoded into a threshold file which rDock can use as an input.
  rbhtfinder attempts to help with this task by automatically
  selecting a combination and writing a threshold file. The
  combination chosen is that which provides the highest enrichment
  factor, after all options with a TIME value over 0.1 are excluded.
  This choice should not be blindly followed, so the threshold file
  should be considered a template that the user modifies as needed.

  rbhtfinder requires NumPy. Installation of pandas is recommended,
  but optional; if pandas is not available, loading the input file
  for calculations will be considerably slower.
